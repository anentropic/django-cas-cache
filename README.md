django-cas-cache
================

Django cache backends supporting CAS (compare-and-set) operation. Memcache,
Redis and Dummy backends.

Provided as a mixin so you can add `cas` method to your existing customised
backend. Or use one of the ready-mixed backends provided:

```python
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'cascache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCASCache',
        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
    }
}
```

The idea of Compare-And-Set is that your new value is based on the existing
value of the key, but it's a way to beat the race condition encountered with
na√Øve implementations. For more details see this blog post by Python's BDFL:

The pattern we use here is that instead of a new value you should pass in an
update function to calculate the new value:

```python
cache = get_cache('default')
success = cache.cas('mykey', lambda x: x * 2)
```
